# Learning Process

## Mindset
### Way of thinking
In IT-Security there are too many topics for one person to learn evrything in a lifetime.
Just like in Software Development, you don't learn every programming language, you learn programming patterns,
from which you can pretty much understand every code.


So in IT Security, we have to learn and adapt the the situation we are working in.
We will have situations where we dont don't know how something works.

Another point is developing the reaseach methodology, the learning process, how to search the Internet.
Becoming a good pentester involves not only passively learning a topic and also actively engaging in it.

Let us take a closer look at the problem. Look at this simple math equation and try to solve it:

20 * ________+ ________ = 65535

20x + x = 65535
21x = 65535 | 21
x = 65535 / 21

### Think OUTSIDE THE BOX

Why didnt you consider changing the equations arithmetic operator, or add some alternative digits.

Welcome to the hackers way of thinking

**"OUTSIDE THE BOX"**

#### Assignment
Why didn't you consider changing the arithmetic operations? Why didn't you think to add more digits? Try to answer as detailed as possible on your own. Try to write about it in at least 200 words.

I didn't consider changing the arithmetic operations because I never ever did, or my previous teachers didn't teach me that I
should do that. It's unnatural to think about changing the operations or adding numbers because I considered there were 
these restrictions in the first place. Restictions that in reality didn't exist, but I assumed were given, because thats
how I was teached.

So in detail I just tried what worked in the past and considered everything to be the same in this example. And my mind doesn't think
adding numbers to this equation would help in the first place, because I learned that math equations must be equal on both sides.
Rules and restrictions that are normal in mathematics. So changing the arithmetic operations and numbers must make the whole equation
wrong.

So in conclusion my though process depends on my experiences in the past, how I learned to approach problems, and how I solved problems in the past.
Restrictions I learned in the past applied in this situation because I assumed it was there. Then I thought about rules of mathematics and how they
are fundemental.

### Occam's Razor

Thinking outside the box helps crossing imaginary boundaries and solving problems that were not recognizable at first.
Problems can get very complicated very fast. The Occam's Razor can help us with that.

Occam's Razor describes that the most simplest answer is the most probable.

Example is: The Computer stopped working.

We can asssume, the CPU or the motherboard or the PSU is broken.
There are many faults to consider and checking them is even more tidious.

The Question we should be asking ourselves is: Why is our computer not getting power?

After hearing that question, we automatically switch our minds to the word "Power", so we must assume the
power supply is broken.

But no, we have to think outside the box. The Power supply is connected over power lines to a power socket, after checking the lines,
we see that the socket is switched off. The computer had no power to start up.

#### Occam's Razor in Practice

Using occams razor in theory sound easier than it is in practice.
It is not alwase the case that is the most simplest answer is the right one.

We must also distinguish the individual details and mechanisms.
It is crucial that we understand the overall concept rather than the steps involved.

### Talent

We all know at least 2 or 3 talented people from our circle.
People that are talented are perceived as having their abilities from Nature.

In reality it didn't come frome nature, it is more that they developed it from early childhood.
Such talents come often from constant or persistant confrontation with problmes or corresponding situations where they are good at.
Such confrontation expands their repertoire and comfort zone with these situations.


## Learning Dependencies
### Way of learning
So why didnt we solve the equation differently, because we solved it the way we learned it. 
Thinking outstide the box is a fundemental thing to the "hacker mindset".

Thinking outside the box also means that we are able to "pivot" from the things we learned before.
We are confronted with so many technologies during the penetration tests that it can become frustrating and confusing if we don't understand some things.
So its important to **know your goal**.

Learning things and solving problems often depend on our **emotional state**. If we feel good and are confortable you are much more likely to solve the problem.
